Mpir.NET
========

Mpir.NET lets you use the [MPIR library](http://mpir.org), which is a GMP fork for Windows,
from .NET languages. 

The current version incorporates 32- and 64-bit builds of MPIR 2.7.2.

F# Example
----------

The type representing MPIR integers is mpz\_t. In F#, you can write literals suffixed with Z, to 
create mpz\_t objects, as in this simple example:

*)

#r "Mpir.NET"
#r "FsMpir.NET"
(** *)

open Mpir.NET

let a = 756749075976907490175905790287846502134Z
let b = 529134916478965674697197076070175107505Z
let c = a*b
printfn "%O" c

C# Example

A short C# example:

Basics
------

As mentioned before, mpz\_t is the class that represents MPIR integers. If you need to use 
any MPIR function that doesn't have a corresponding mpz\_t method, it can be found in the 
static mpir class, where the original MPIR/GMP function names are preserved. For example, 
call mpz\_addmul like so:

*)
mpir.mpz_addmul(c, a, b);

Supported CPUs
--------------

Mpir.NET includes an MPIR 32-bit build for Pentium 3 (p3 target in MPIR), and a 
64-bit build for K8. In other words, Mpir.NET runs on Pentiums and later x86 32-bit
CPUs, and all x64 64-bit CPUs. It will not run on pre-Pentium 3 PCs (which would be 
from 1999 or earlier) or weird stuff like Itaniums.

Origins
-------

Mpir.NET is basically a fusion of modified versions
of X-MPIR by Sergey Bochkanov and "GMP for .NET" by Emil Stefanov.
